h1  About Me
p
  | I was born to a hardworking and loving single mother in the Midwest in the late 1990s. I attended primary school in St. Louis and Springfield, Missouri.
  | After graduating from high school, I enrolled at Missouri State University in Springfield, Missouri, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
  | with a minor in Mathematics in 2019. During my time in school, my interests primarily revolved around artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly
  | unsupervised learning. However, my perspective shifted during my senior year when I took an information assurance class, and I discovered that my true passion lay
  | in cybersecurity. To hone my skills in this field, I embarked on a journey through platforms like TryHackMe and eventually progressed to HackTheBox. While these
  | experiences were incredibly enjoyable and valuable learning opportunities, I also needed a source of income to cover my expenses. Concurrently, I worked as an intern
  | at a utility company, where I provided support and maintenance for SharePoint sites. This role allowed me to establish strong connections with members of both the IT
  | department and the HR department. Impressed by my performance and dedication, I received a recommendation to transition into a project management role. Initially,
  | I worked as a waterfall project manager. However, I soon realized that the rapidly changing nature of business objectives rendered this approach less effective.
  | As a result, I pursued certification as a Scrum Master. In the subsequent year, I took on the role of a project manager responsible for supporting the production
  | implementation of Workday and the ongoing development of enhancements and integrations.
