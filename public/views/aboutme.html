      <h1> About Me</h1>
      <p>I was born to a hardworking and loving single mother in the Midwest in the late 1990s. I attended primary school in St. Louis and Springfield, Missouri.
         After graduating from high school, I enrolled at Missouri State University in Springfield, Missouri, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
         with a minor in Mathematics in 2019. During my time in school, my interests primarily revolved around artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly
         unsupervised learning. However, my perspective shifted during my senior year when I took an information assurance class, and I discovered that my true passion lay
         in cybersecurity. To hone my skills in this field, I embarked on a journey through platforms like TryHackMe and eventually progressed to HackTheBox. While these 
         experiences were incredibly enjoyable and valuable learning opportunities, I also needed a source of income to cover my expenses. Concurrently, I worked as an intern
         at a utility company, where I provided support and maintenance for SharePoint sites. This role allowed me to establish strong connections with members of both the IT
         department and the HR department. Impressed by my performance and dedication, I received a recommendation to transition into a project management role. Initially,
         I worked as a waterfall project manager. However, I soon realized that the rapidly changing nature of business objectives rendered this approach less effective.
         As a result, I pursued certification as a Scrum Master. In the subsequent year, I took on the role of a project manager responsible for supporting the production
         implementation of Workday and the ongoing development of enhancements and integrations.
