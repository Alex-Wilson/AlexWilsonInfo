#### Guide to Deploy a Website

## No Code Start Up

# Assumptions and Introduction

# Password Manager
    Running a website of any size will require many accounts. These accounts will require email addresses and passwords. In order to safely store and retrieve passwords we MUST use a password manager. I recommend KeyPassXC or any other self-hosted and open-source password manager. Create a high enrtropy master password via the XKDC technique or with a cryptograhically sercure string generator like the one in KeyPassXC. Memorize this master password. Avoid keyboard walks, word-juctions, and symbol replacement/concatanation.

    TO-DO:
    Create secure AND memorable masterpassword.
    Download and install password manager.
    Create vault/volume in which to store passwords.
    Secure vault/volume with password.

# Email Address
    It is best practice to use a new, unique, and purposeful email address for each online service. This address should not disclose any personal or confidential information (year/month/date of birth, first/last/maiden/pet names, location, interests, etc.) It is best to host your own email service but if you are unable to, then use a relatively secure and discreet service like Proton.me. Email addresses are  commonly used to track people across different websites and services. Use an email relay service.

    TO-DO:
    Create email account.
    Configure an email relay. Can use Firefox Relay or alternatives. All relay email addresses and passwords will be stored in the password manager.
    Configure Multi Factor Authentication. Avoid SMS/Voice authentication.
    Configure recovery protocol.

## Domain Name Aquisition
    
    TO-DO:
    Determine Top Level Domain name (.com, .org, .net, etc.)
